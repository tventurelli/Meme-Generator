## User Stories

User Types:

- **Joe** runs a website that provides a set of gifs for its users to use on his site.
- **Alice** maintains a pop culture website.
- **Jane** works for a company that advertises on social media.
- **Mark** is a student and casual meme enjoyer.

AS Joe
I WANT TO have an easy and reliable way to curate memes for my website
SO THAT user interaction is increased and I do not have to worry about moderating user-uploaded memes.

AS Alice
I WANT TO have a quick and expansive resource that helps me find new memes
SO THAT I can add flavor to my site's articles and get more page views.

AS Jane
I WANT TO have access to a wide variety of popular memes
SO THAT I can use memes in advertisements to reach my company's target demographic and increase sales.

AS Mark
I WANT TO view as many memes as possible
SO THAT I can avoid doing more substantial things.
